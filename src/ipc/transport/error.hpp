/**
 * Namespace containing the ipc::transport module's extension of boost.system error conventions, so that that API
 * can return codes/messages from within its own new set of error codes/messages.  Note that many errors
 * ipc::transport might report are system errors and would not draw from this set of codes/messages but rather
 * from `boost::asio::error` or `boost::system::errc` (possibly others).  (If you're familiar with the boost.system
 * framework, you'll know such mixing is normal -- in fact arguably one of its strengths.)
 *
 * @see ipc::transport::struc::error which covers errors from the *structured* layer (ipc::transport::struc).
 *      The present namespace applies to unstructured/lower-level traffic or to both that and structured/higher-level.
 *
 * See flow's `flow::net_flow::error` doc header which was used as the model for this and similar.
 * As of this writing there is discussion there useful for someone new to boost.system error reporting.
 *
 * @internal
 *
 * @todo This file and error.cpp are perfectly reasonable and worth-it and standard boiler-plate; and
 * it's not that lengthy really; but it'd be nice to stop having to copy/paste all the stuff outside of just the
 * error codes and messages.  Should add a feature to Flow that'll reduce the boiler-plate to just that; maybe
 * some kind of base class or something.  boost.system already makes it pretty easy, but even that can probably be
 * "factored out" into Flow.  Update: I (ygoldfel) took a look at it for another project, and so far no obvious
 * de-boiler-plate ideas come to mind.  Ideally the inputs are: (1) an `enum` with the codes, like error::Code;
 * (2) an `int`-to-`string` message table function, for log messages; and (3) a brief `const char*` identifying the
 * code set, for log messages.  The rest is the boiler-plate, but all of it seems to either already be accepably
 * brief, and where something isn't quite so, I can't think of any obvious way to factor it out.
 * Of course a macro-based "meta-language" is always a possibility, as we did in `flow::log`, but in this case it
 * doesn't seem worth it at all.

 * When you add a value to this `enum`, also add its description to

 *
 * When you add a value to this `enum`, also add its symbolic representation to error.cpp's
 * error.cpp's Category::code_symbol().  This string must be identical to the symbol, minus the `S_`;

 *
 * If, when adding a new revision of the code, you add a value to this `enum`, add it to the end, but ahead of

 * If, when adding a new revision of the code, you deprecate a value in this `enum`, do not delete
 * it from this `enum`.  Instead mark it as deprecated here and then remove it from
 * Ipc_transport_category::message().
 *
 * Errors that indicate apparent logic bugs (in other words, assertions that we were too afraid
 * to write as actual `assert()`s) should be prefixed with `S_INTERNAL_ERROR_`, and their messages
 * should also indicate "Internal error: ".  This mirrors Flow's convention.

/**
 * Serializes a transport::error::Code to a standard output stream.  The output string is compatible with the reverse
 * `istream>>` operator.
 *
 * ### Rationale ###
 * This shall print a representation that looks like the identifier in C++ code; e.g.,
 * Code::S_INVALID_ARGUMENT => `"INVALID_ARGUMENT"`.  Nevertheless, when printing an #Error_code storing
 * a Code, continue to do the standard thing: output the #Error_code (which will print the category name, in our
 * case, something like `"ipc/transport"`; and the numeric `enum` value) itself plus its `.message()`
 * (which will print a natural-language message).  Naturally that technique will work with any #Error_code, including
 * but *not* limited to one storing a Code.
 *
 * So why does the present `operator<<` even exist?  Answer: Primarily it's in order to enable a consistent, yet
 * human-friendly, machinery of serializing/deserializing `Code`s.  No such machinery exists for general #Error_code,
 * and specifying an #Error_code in an input stream would probably invovle (at least) providing a numeric value; but
 * we can still provide a symbolic [de]serialization for specifically transport::error::Code.  Why did we want that?
 * Answer: The original use case was in testing scenarios, to easily specify an expected outcome of an ipc::transport
 * API call symbolically instead of resorting to numeric `enum` values (it's nicer to say "expect INVALID_ARGUMENT"
 * rather than "expect 13" -- though incidentally the latter also works).
 *
 * @param os
 *        Stream to which to serialize.
 * @param val
 *        Value to serialize.
 * @return `os`.
